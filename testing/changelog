ptr.h:
	simplified (and disabled) TRACE() macro
	made all methods inline
	added default value to regular constructor
	replaced implicit cast operator with explicit raw() accessor
	added friend declaration: forall U, Ptr<T> is a friend
	added copy constructor for Ptr<U>
	added (in)equality operators for Ptr<U>

java_lang.h:
	changed all convenience typedefs from T* to __rt::Ptr<T>
	added accessor for canonical null value
	added simulatted virtual __delete() to all data/vtable layouts
	made all vtables public to support translation of "super"
		thanks to Mike Chrzanowski for identifying this issue
	added support for java.lang.String (wrapping a C++ string)
	removed memset() from array constructor
	added specialization for __Array<int32_t> constructor with memset()
	added __rt::stringify()
	removed now unused __checkArrayIndex
	moved __checkNotNull() and __checkArrayStore() into __rt
	changed both functions to use Ptr<T> and null()
	
java_lang.cc:
	added implementations for __delete()
	added calls to raw() to
		__Object::hashCode()
		__Object::toString()
	replaced 0 with calls to __rt::null() in
		__Object::__class()
		__Class::isArray()
		__Class::isInstance()
		__Integer::__primitiveClass()
	eliminated now unnecessary upcast in __Class::isInstance()
	added definition of __rt::null()
	wrapped all usage of C/C++ strings with __rt::stringify()
	
main.cc:
	added code to exercise strings
	added calls to raw() for printing pointer address in b[1]
